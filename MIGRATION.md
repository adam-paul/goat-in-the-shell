# Product Requirements Document: Goat in the Shell Multiplayer Architecture Migration

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** Goat in the Shell Multiplayer Migration
**Summary:** A comprehensive refactoring of the existing Goat in the Shell game from a client-centric architecture to a server-authoritative multiplayer system, preserving gameplay experience while enhancing scalability, security, and multiplayer synchronization.

## 2. Background

The current Goat in the Shell implementation uses Phaser.js with client-side physics and game logic. This approach has limitations for true multiplayer gameplay:
- Susceptibility to client-side cheating and manipulation
- Synchronization challenges between players
- Limited scalability for additional features
- Inconsistent gameplay experiences between players

## 3. Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals
- Preserve the exact same gameplay experience and visual styling
- Establish server authority for all game state and physics
- Create a clean, modular codebase that separates concerns
- Enable reliable, low-latency multiplayer experiences

### Measurable Objectives
- Maintain visual parity with the existing game
- Achieve <100ms latency in multiplayer interactions
- Support fluid 60FPS rendering on clients
- Eliminate possibility of client-side cheating
- Maintain or improve code maintainability metrics

### Key Components

#### Client
- **GameRenderer:** Visualizes game state using Phaser, without physics
- **InputHandler:** Captures user actions and sends to server
- **ClientNetworkManager:** Manages WebSocket connection and message handling
- **UI Components:** React-based interface elements (modals, panels, controls)

#### Server
- **PhysicsEngine:** Server-side physics implementation (Matter.js or similar)
- **GameStateManager:** Maintains authoritative world state
- **ServerNetworkManager:** Handles client connections and message routing
- **GameLogicProcessor:** Implements game rules and validates actions

#### Shared
- **GameTypes:** TypeScript interfaces for game objects and states
- **NetworkProtocol:** Message definitions for client-server communication
- **Constants:** Shared values like speeds, dimensions, and physics properties

## 5. Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
1. ✅ Create directory structure
2. Set up basic React application in client/ 
3. Set up CSS and styling bases
4. Create server skeleton with WebSocket support
5. Define shared type interfaces for game objects

### Phase 2: Client Refactoring
1. Create rendering system that works without physics
2. Implement input capture and network transmission
3. Build state management system for interpolation
4. Create UI components matching original functionality
5. Develop debug visualization for network status

### Phase 3: Server Implementation
1. Implement physics engine with Matter.js
2. Create game state manager with snapshots
3. Build validation system for user inputs
4. Implement game logic for win/lose conditions
5. Create entity management system

### Phase 4: Networking
1. Design message protocol for client-server communication
2. Implement server-side message router
3. Build client-side network listener
4. Create reconciliation system for client predictions
5. Implement entity interpolation for smooth rendering

### Phase 5: Integration and Refinement
1. Connect client rendering to server state updates
2. Implement lobby system
3. Add player authentication
4. Optimize for bandwidth and latency
5. Add reconnection capabilities

## 6. Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Network Latency
**Solution:** Implement client-side prediction with server reconciliation to make gameplay feel responsive while maintaining server authority.

### Challenge: State Synchronization
**Solution:** Use timestamped state snapshots with delta compression to minimize bandwidth while ensuring consistent game states.

### Challenge: Scalability
**Solution:** Design server architecture to allow horizontal scaling with multiple game instances.

### Challenge: Phaser Adaptation
**Solution:** Use Phaser as a rendering engine only, bypassing its physics engine in favor of visualizing server-computed positions.

## 7. Migration Strategy

### Approach
1. Begin with a parallel implementation, keeping the original game functional
2. Build and test server components in isolation
3. Integrate client with server in stages, focusing on core mechanics first
4. Validate gameplay experience against original before finalizing

### Compatibility
- Ensure players can transition seamlessly to the new architecture
- Maintain visual and control consistency throughout migration

## 8. Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Create tests for physics calculations
- Validate input handling
- Test network message processing

### Integration Testing
- Verify client-server communication
- Test game state synchronization
- Validate UI component interactions

### Performance Testing
- Measure network bandwidth requirements
- Test under various latency conditions
- Verify rendering performance on target devices

### Multiplayer Testing
- Test with varying numbers of simultaneous players
- Verify correct handling of player disconnections
- Test edge cases like simultaneous actions

## 9. Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. Players cannot distinguish the gameplay experience from the original
2. Server maintains authoritative control over all game state
3. Multiplayer synchronization is smooth and consistent
4. Codebase is organized according to the new architecture
5. Game performs within latency and FPS targets

## 10. Next Steps and Action Items

1. Complete the remaining client file skeletons
2. Create the server application entry point
3. Define the network protocol specification in shared/
4. Begin implementation of the server physics engine
5. Adapt client rendering to work with server state
